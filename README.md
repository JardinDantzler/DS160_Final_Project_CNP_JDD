# UCI_CoverType_Machine_Learning

Project using supervised machine learning techniques from sklearn to predict forest coverage type based on data on soil samples.

The main dataset exists on the UCI machine learning repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype]

This project uses a small subset of that dataset, which was featured in a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction
