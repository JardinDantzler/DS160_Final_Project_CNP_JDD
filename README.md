# UCI_CoverType_Machine_Learning

#### Authors: Jardin Dantzler and Caleb Puckett 

#### Version: 2.4.1 

Project using supervised machine learning techniques from sklearn to work on the classification nad prediction of the forest coverage type based on data given.

Along with a .docx for a more in depth breakdown of our project and lines of code.

The dataset exists on the UCI machine learning repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype]
